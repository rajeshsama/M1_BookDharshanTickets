# Requirements

* This Project is designed for easy access of devotees information who visited the temple, this project can also able to give the serial ticket numbers where it can give the exact count of devotees visited the temple on a single day.
* This project is useful for the temple management for their records and maintainance and will also used to track how many devotees will be visiting on specific days by analysing the previous recorded data, so that the temple management can do better arrangements and can make the events or festive days better ways for dharshanam on special days for the devotees. 
* This project is baically developled by using C programming techniques which will able to run on Windows, Linux and different platforms so that the project will be used anywhere and anytime.

# Analysis

* In this project, we can able to give the exact data to the temple management and also the privacy policies to the devotees, hence the management and the devotee will be satisfied from both the ends. 
* The main weakness of the project is the devottes can't book the tickets on thier own, the managemnt have to book the tickets and give it to the devotees.
* We can also add more features to the designed proect where we can make it accessable to the devotees directly and can make them avail thier dharshan tickets by themselves from the devotees menu and also we can make additional message system to their mobile numbers about their ticket booking conformation.
* For every project there might be some threats, for this also there may get some threat for the information that was recorded in the portal. We can able to make the securuty strong for not to theft it by the other users other than the temple management.
